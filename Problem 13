Your Task:
Your task is to complete the function getInput() to take input of strings and learn how to correctly take input and print the variables in the same order as taken in input.

Expected Time Complexity: O(1).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Solution:
class Geeks {
    static void getInput() {

        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int t = sc.nextInt(); // Taking the number of testcases
        sc.nextLine();
        while (t-- > 0) {
            int a = sc.nextInt();
            sc.nextLine();
            String s = sc.nextLine();

            // Your code here
            

            System.out.println(a);
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
}
