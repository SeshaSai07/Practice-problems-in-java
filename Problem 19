Question:
Given a number, you have to use the if statement to print "Big" (without quotes) if the given number is greater than 100. The statement "Number" (without quotes) will be printed regardless. Just write an if statement at the mentioned place that prints "Big" if the given number is greater than 100.

Examples :

Input: number = 10
Output: Number 
Explanation: 10 is less than 100, so we don't print Big and Number will be printed by default.
Input: number = 101
Output:
Big
Number
Explanation: 101 is greater than 100,so we print Big.

Solution:
// User function Template for Java
class Solution {
    public static void utility(int number) {
        // Write your if statement below
            if(number > 100){
                System.out.println("Big");
            }

        // Write your if statement above
        System.out.println("Number");
    }
}
