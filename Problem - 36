Question:
Given an array arr. Return the element that occurs at least k number of times.

Note:

If there are multiple answers, please return the first one.
If there is no element found, return -1.
Examples

Input: arr[] = [1, 7, 4, 3, 4, 8, 7], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Both 7 and 4 occur 2 times. But 4 is first that occurs twice. As the index = 4, is the first element.
Input:  arr[] = [3, 1, 3, 4, 5, 1, 3, 3, 5, 4], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Here, 3 is the only number that appeared atleast 3 times in the array.
Input: arr[] = [10, 8, 2], k = 10
Output: -1
Explanation: Here no element is returning atleast 10 number of times, so -1.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public int firstElementKTime(int[] arr, int k) {
        // write code
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            freq.put(num, freq.getOrDefault(num , 0) + 1);
            
            if (freq.get(num) == k) {
                return num;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
