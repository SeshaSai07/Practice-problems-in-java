Question:
Given two numbers a and b; you need to perform basic mathematical operation on them. You will be provided an integer named as operator. 
If operator equals to 1 add a and b, then print the result as a string.
If operator equals to 2 subtract b from a, then print the result as a string.
If operator equals to 3 multiply a and b, then print the result as a string.
If operator equals to any another number, print "Invalid Input"(without quotes).
Note: Do not add a new line at the end

Examples:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, opr = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 * 2 = 2
Input: a = 2, b = 2, opr = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: 2 - 2 = 0

Solution:
class Solution {
    public static void utility(int a, int b, int opr) {
        // code here
      if (opr == 1)
      {
          System.out.print(String.valueOf(a + b));
      }
      else if (opr == 2) 
      {
          System.out.print(String.valueOf(a - b));
      }
      else if (opr == 3)
      {
          System.out.print(String.valueOf(a * b));
      }
      else
      {
          System.out.print("Invalid Input");
      }
    }
}
