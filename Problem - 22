Question:
You are given a number a and you have to print your answer according to the following:

If the number is divisible by 3, you print "Fizz" (without quotes)
If the number is divisible by 5, you print "Buzz" (without quotes)
If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, you print "FizzBuzz" (without quotes)
In any other case, you print the number itself
Note: You should add a new-line character after print statement.

Examples:

Input: a = 3
Output: Fizz
Explanation: Here, the number is divisible by 3, so Fizz is printed.
Input: a = 5
Output: Buzz
Explanation: Here the number is divisible by 5, so Buzz is printed.
Input: a = 15
Output: FizzBuzz
Explanation: Here, the number 15 is divisible by both 3 and 5, so FizzBuzz is printed.

Solution:
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        // Your Code Here
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int a = sc.nextInt();
        if(a % 3 == 0 && a % 5 == 0) {
            System.out.println("FizzBuzz");
        }
        else if(a % 3 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Fizz");
        }
        else if(a % 5 == 0) {
            System.out.println("Buzz");
        }
        else {
            System.out.println(a);
        }
    }
}
